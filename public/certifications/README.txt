Put your certification images in this folder.

Recommended:
- Put issuer logos in: /public/certifications/logos/
- Format: .webp (best) or .png
- Size: square-ish (e.g. 256x256) for fast loading
- Naming: use kebab-case, e.g. oracle.webp, microsoft.webp

Then reference them in `src/constants.js` like:
issuerLogo: "/certifications/logos/oracle.webp"
